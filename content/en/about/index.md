My research is in data-driven astrophysics and cosmology. This means I'm somewhere between being an astronomer and a physicist, somewhere between a theorist, observer and statistician. I also teach data science to astronomy PhD students as part of the Rubin Observatory Data Science Fellowship Program.

Over the last century, we have discovered that the universe consists primarily of baryons (or "normal" matter), dark matter, and dark energy. Dark matter and dark energy together contribute 95% of the mass-energy budget and are therefore key for determining the behavior of the universe on the largest scales, that is, cosmology. However, since they both influence the behavior of and are primarily understood through astrophysical measurements of the baryons, neither astrophysics nor cosmology can be viewed completely independently. My work aims at this intersection.

Although this can be controversial depending on the circles you find yourself in, scientists tend to believe that there is truth in the world, and that it is our job to find it. How do we do this?

One way is through the notion of 'conditioning our beliefs on the data'. That is, we believe things that the data support more strongly than things that the data do not support. This can be done in a quantitative manner through the methods of Bayesian statistics that provide a powerful link between data and theory. Since our data includes contributions from astrophysics and cosmology together, this poses both practical and theoretical challenges.

These ideas are made concrete on my research, publications and blog.

I am a science educator and a passionate advocate for improving the climate in physics and astronomy. I'm a first generation college student and ally. I work to support a more diverse and inclusive community. At UCR, I did this through the Physics Organization for Womxn and the Underrepresented and by co-leading UCR's American Physical Society - Inclusion Diversity and Equity Alliance team with Flip Tanedo and Elizabeth Finney.
